# Automated karst detection
This is a tool constructed in ArcGIS Modelbuilder for the purpose of easily applying automated karst detection methods (Doctor and Young, 2013, Wall and others, 2015) to Lidar-based DEMs. **Features identified by this tool represent modelled results only and are not ground-truthed.**

This tool is intended to run in ArcGIS Pro. For a detailed explanation of the karst tool, review this presentation: [Using ModelBuilder in ArcGIS to auto-generate sinkholes from digital elevation models](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Info/dmt/docs/DMT22_Finnerty.pdf)

To access the tool, download the .atbx file using **Code > Download ZIP**. Unzip and open the .atbx in ArcGIS Pro.

This tool was developed for Virginia Energy, Geology and Mineral Resources Program by Patrick C. Finnerty and Anne C. Witt in 2022.
